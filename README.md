# Arduino - Power Relay

This project uses a Vizio remote to switch a relay allowing household voltage to pass through it. On and off states are each set to their own buttons.  

I made this as a means of allowing power to pass to my finicky Vizio TV which will only turn on if it has JUST been plugged in not when it has been sitting.
The board used is the [Metro Mini 328](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2590) and the relay used is the [SparkFun Beefcake Relay](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13815).
